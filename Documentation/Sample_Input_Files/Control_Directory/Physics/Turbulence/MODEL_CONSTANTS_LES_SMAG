#===========================================================================
# This is a sample of model constant definition file, and is model-specific. 
#
# Undoubtebly, it is an expert options, and user must have a pretty good 
# understanding of the model and the flow physics to tune these numbers.
#
# For this particular case, LES_SMAG, only Smagorinsky constant is given.
