This directory contains files needed to run computation of flow over 
backstep facing step of Re = 28000 with heat transfer. The results are compared 
to experiments of Vogel and Eaton 1985. 
In the folder you will find two scripts, one for mesh generation by Generator, 
T-FlowS mesh generator, and another for  
spliting mesh into 2 sub-domains for parallel execution. Number of sub-domains
can be easily changed by editing the script.  
For mesh generator simply call this script

./Mesh_gen.scr

for division call

./Mesh_divide.scr
