CGNS depends on HDF5.

If you want to use parallel HDF5, then HDF5 must be built with mpi lib

Latest two versions of HDF5 are 5.1.8 and 5.1.10

To build and install CNGS edit, then execute install_cgns.sh script

--------------------------------------------------
Things to consider by yourself:

1) They are both on the bitbucket website, which mean you can get them with following command:

git clone --depth=1  https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/scm/hdffv/hdf5.git --branch hdf5_1_8 --single-branch ./HDF5

, but branch hdf5_1_10 does not have "configure" file, only cmake configure files.

Version 5.1.10 with configure file is placed at website:

wget https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.10.1.tar

2) before you can build HDF5 for Fortran you may need to build mpi manually since 

repository mpif90 was built with different gfortran version.

And this means when compiler meets an obligatory function that has an header:

"
  USE MPI
"

it will not pass this test and fail configuration.

If you want to use " use mpi" you must build mpi by yourself.

Instructions for that are added below.

Otherwise you can comment "use mpi" and put " include 'mpif.h'" after "implicit none".

At the moment only "fortran/testpar/ptest.f90" function has "USE MPI" header. (*)

Futher below I show instructions for standard mpif90 from repository (which imply(*) )
